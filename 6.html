  <ul>
    <li>Linearity: Revenues and costs are assumed to be linear. That means the selling price per unit would never change and every customer would pay exactly the same price per unit. </li>
    <li>Relevant range: The company would always operate within the relevant range. There would never be a need to increase or decrease capacity.</li>
    <li>Productivity: Productivity or technological changes would not occur to change the behavior of costs from variable to fixed. </li>
    <li>Inventory: There would be no change in the amount of inventory carried by the company. The quantity of units sold would always equal the quantity purchased and/or produced.</li>
    <li>Inflation: There would be no inflation or deflation. Inflation and deflation tend to make fixed costs appear variable.</li>
    <li>Sales mix: If the company sells more than one product or service, the sales mix would remain constant.</li>
    <li>Opportunity cost: The traditional accounting approach to calculating breakeven assumes that the opportunity costs of the business model are zero when multiple years are considered.</li>
  </ul>
